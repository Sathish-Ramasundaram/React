        <h1>React Render HTML</h1>
        <p>
            React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.
            <br>
            React renders HTML to the web page via a container, and a function called createRoot().
        </p>
        <h2>The Container</h2>
        <p>
            React uses a container to render HTML in a web page.
            <br>
            Typically, this container is a &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; element in the index.html file.
            <br>
            To better understand the content of the index.html file, let's remove all the code we don't need and keep as the below screenshot.

        <h2>The createRoot Function</h2>
        <p>
            The createRoot function is located in the main.jsx file in the src folder, and is a built-in function that is used to create a root node for a React application.
            <br>
            The createRoot() function takes one argument, an HTML element.
            <br>
            The purpose of the function is to define the HTML element where a React component should be displayed.
            <br>To better understand the createRoot function, let's remove unnecessary code and write our own "Hello React!" example:
