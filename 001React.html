        <h2>What is React?</h2>
        <p>React is a front-end JavaScript library.
            <br>React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer Jordan Walke.
            <br>React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.
            <br>React is a tool for building UI components.
        </p>
        <h2>How does React Work?</h2>
        <p>
            React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
            <br>Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
            <br>React only changes what needs to be changed!
            <br>React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
